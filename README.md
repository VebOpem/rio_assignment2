# BEM

BEM - What is it?
BEM (Block Element Modifier)
A methodology that helps you create reusable components and code sharing in front-end development.

BEM - block \_ \_ element - - modifier

Block
"A functionally independent page component that can be reused. In HTML, blocks are represented by the class attribute."

    Example:
        .button {
        text-transform: uppercase;
        }

Element
"A composite part of a block that can't be used separately from it."

        Example:
            .button__action {
            background-color: $themeGreen--light;
            }

Modifier
"An entity that defines the appearance, state, or behavior of a block or element."

        The modifier name describes its appearance, state and behavior.

        Example:
            .button__action--dark {
            background-color: $themeGreen--dark;
            }
